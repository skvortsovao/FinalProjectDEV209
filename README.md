You will get all proper cities in chosen country. 
The order is important - the first is city name then comma then country. Example - London, GB or New York, US.

Current Limitations

Google API Restrictions

If the proxy is down, Google API requests may fail.
Switching to corsproxy.io or setting up a backend proxy is recommended.
OpenWeather API updates data every few minutes, so real-time data may not always be 100% accurate.
